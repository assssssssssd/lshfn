      Psyche breaks the ban; she looks at her enchanted 
      husband at night and recognizes him as Cupid, the 
      god of love. She goes through many trials to return 
      to her beloved, and everything ends up fine - Psyche 
      gains immortality to live with her divine husband. 
      This plot is played out in many myths and fairy tales, 
      and not always its variations end well - the 
      connection between the lovers' worlds after breaking 
      the ban on knowledge is often broken, and the 
      mysterious spouse returns to their worlds 
      inaccessible to humans. Olivia Lang, recalling the 
      legend of "Cherry of Zennor,"
      
      writes of the broken 
      prohibition as looking beyond the boundary between 
      worlds--Cherry smears ointment on her eyes that 
      must not be touched, the ointment burns them, 
      Cherry washes her face with water from a spring and 
      spots little dancing men in it, among whom her 
      master 
      (Cherry, of course, is in love with him).
      
      
      A 
      broken prohibition is often followed by banishment 
      (Cherry's story) or disappearance (when the spouse 
      burns the frog/snake/swan/elven skin of her werewolf 
      lover).	These legends are built on the fragile 
      boundaries between the worlds of the lovers, whose 
      distinction is magically emphasized. Their 
      intersection brings one or both spouses closer and 
      farther apart, refracts and changes the nature of one 
      or both of them. It is on these intersections that 
      caustic shimmering worlds are built, in which 
      mystery, trust, the magical and otherwise magical 
      are no longer distinguished
